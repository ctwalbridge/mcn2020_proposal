The code repository Github is a great place to find projects shared by your colleagues in cultural heritage documentation. In this introductory session, Jeremy and Charles will walk through the Github process for two projects: a stand-alone (droplet-thing) for converting TIFFs to JPEG 2000, and custom scripts to extend the capabilities of Capture One. They'll show how to find, download, and run the code, and how to upload your changes to the code back to Github.

GitHub as community and technology built around a particular method of version control for groups to work together, I think photographers will catch on quickly. But it applies to anyone with images, word docs, or spreadsheets that have had to go through their own or someone else’s directories full of files named things like filename_edit3.tif or filename_final6NoReallyThisTime.doc

Abstract description (new): The code repository Github is a great place to find projects shared by your colleagues in cultural heritage documentation. In this introductory session, Jeremy and Charles will walk through the Github process for two projects: a text-based studio workflow document, and some custom Python scripts to expand the capabilities of Capture One.
GitHub is a community and technology built around a particular method of version control, and it's a great way for groups to work together. It can be used for text documents, spreadsheets, or code.

Proposed session format: (e.g. round-table discussion, multi-presenter panel, single presenter case study, etc.) Zoom / Hangouts / GoToMeeting with two presenters and a moderator


Key learning outcomes: “After attending, participants will be able to…” After attending, participants will be able to search Github for code to improve their image capture workflows, and will have basic knowledge about how to download, modify, and run code from Github. (We should expand this so it doesn't just include code - it should include document workflows as well )


How does this session contribute to the conference theme, MCN, and the museum sector: (200 words max) Jeremy and Charles are always working to expand the collective knowledge of cultural heritage photographers. Projects like Jeremy's Coding for Cultural Heritage (it's coding4ch on Github) are resources for photographers, but using the code base can have a steep learning curve. We want to give heritage photographers a start in using Github for their own projects, and let them know how they can share their code customizations with others. This session would fit into MCN's conference Strand 2 or 3, as 'integrating new tools...to promote adoption and success' and 'writing and testing open-source code for the collective benefit of organizations.'

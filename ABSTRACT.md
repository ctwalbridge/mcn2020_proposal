The code repository Github is a great place to find projects shared by your colleagues in cultural heritage documentation. In this introductory session, Jeremy and Charles will walk through the Github process for two projects: a stand-alone (droplet-thing) for converting TIFFs to JPEG 2000, and custom scripts to extend the capabilities of Capture One. They'll show how to find, download, and run the code, and how to upload your changes to the code back to Github.

GitHub as community and technology built around a particular method of version control for groups to work together, I think photographers will catch on quickly. But it applies to anyone with images, word docs, or spreadsheets that have had to go through their own or someone elseâ€™s directories full of files named things like filename_edit3.tif or filename_final6NoReallyThisTime.doc
